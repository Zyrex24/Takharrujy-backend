# Takharrujy Platform - GitHub Best Practices and Branching Strategy

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** December 2024  
**Project:** Takharrujy (تخرجي) - University Graduation Project Management Platform  
**Team Size:** 2 Backend Developers  

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive research of GitHub best practices, this document establishes the optimal branching strategy and development workflow for the Takharrujy platform. The recommended approach combines **Feature Branch Workflow** with **endpoint-specific branching** for API development, utilizing `main` and `develop` branches with strict protection rules.

## Recommended Branching Strategy: Enhanced Feature Branch Workflow

### 1. Branch Structure

```
Repository Structure:
├── main                    # Production-ready code (protected)
├── develop                 # Integration branch (protected)
├── feature/auth-register   # Feature: User registration endpoint
├── feature/auth-login      # Feature: User login endpoint
├── feature/projects-create # Feature: Project creation endpoint
├── feature/tasks-crud      # Feature: Task CRUD endpoints
├── hotfix/security-patch   # Hotfix: Critical security fix
└── release/v1.0           # Release preparation branch
```

### 2. Branch Types and Naming Conventions

#### Main Branches (Long-lived)
- **`main`** - Production-ready code, always deployable
- **`develop`** - Integration branch for features, pre-release testing

#### Supporting Branches (Short-lived)
- **`feature/*`** - New features and endpoint development
- **`bugfix/*`** - Bug fixes and minor corrections
- **`hotfix/*`** - Critical production fixes
- **`release/*`** - Release preparation and stabilization

#### Endpoint-Specific Naming Convention
```bash
# Authentication endpoints
feature/auth-register
feature/auth-login
feature/auth-refresh
feature/auth-password-reset

# Project management endpoints
feature/projects-create
feature/projects-update
feature/projects-delete
feature/projects-members

# Task management endpoints
feature/tasks-create
feature/tasks-update
feature/tasks-assign
feature/tasks-dependencies

# File management endpoints
feature/files-upload
feature/files-download
feature/files-versioning

# Notification endpoints
feature/notifications-send
feature/notifications-preferences
```

## Detailed Workflow Process

### 3. Feature Development Workflow

#### Step 1: Feature Branch Creation
```bash
# Start from develop branch
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Create feature branch for specific endpoint
git checkout -b feature/auth-register

# Push feature branch to remote
git push -u origin feature/auth-register
```

#### Step 2: Development Process
```bash
# Regular development cycle
git add .
git commit -m "feat(auth): implement user registration endpoint

- Add UserController.register() method
- Implement email validation with university domains
- Add Arabic language support for error messages
- Include comprehensive unit tests

Closes #123"

# Push changes regularly
git push origin feature/auth-register
```

#### Step 3: Keep Feature Branch Updated
```bash
# Regularly sync with develop branch
git fetch origin
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout feature/auth-register
git merge develop

# Resolve any conflicts and push
git push origin feature/auth-register
```

#### Step 4: Pull Request Process
```bash
# When feature is complete, create Pull Request
# From: feature/auth-register
# To: develop
# Include comprehensive description and testing notes
```

#### Step 5: Integration and Release
```bash
# After PR approval and merge to develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# When ready for release
git checkout -b release/v1.0
# Final testing and bug fixes
# Merge to main and tag release
```

### 4. Commit Message Standards

#### Conventional Commits Format
```bash
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

#### Examples for Takharrujy Platform
```bash
# Feature implementation
feat(auth): implement JWT authentication system

- Add JwtTokenProvider service
- Implement token validation middleware
- Include refresh token functionality
- Add comprehensive security tests

Closes #45

# Bug fix
fix(projects): resolve project creation validation error

- Fix university domain validation logic
- Add proper error handling for Arabic text
- Update validation messages for better UX

Fixes #67

# Documentation
docs(api): update authentication endpoint documentation

- Add request/response examples
- Include Arabic language considerations
- Update Postman collection references

# Performance improvement
perf(database): optimize project query performance

- Add strategic indexes on frequently queried columns
- Implement query result caching
- Reduce database connection overhead

# Breaking change
feat(api)!: restructure authentication response format

BREAKING CHANGE: Authentication response now includes user profile data
in nested 'user' object instead of root level properties.

Migration guide available in CHANGELOG.md
```

### 5. Branch Protection Rules

#### Main Branch Protection
```yaml
branch_protection_rules:
  main:
    required_status_checks:
      strict: true
      contexts:
        - "ci/build"
        - "ci/test"
        - "ci/security-scan"
        - "ci/performance-test"
    enforce_admins: true
    required_pull_request_reviews:
      required_approving_review_count: 2
      dismiss_stale_reviews: true
      require_code_owner_reviews: true
      restrictions:
        users: ["senior-developer", "tech-lead"]
    restrictions:
      push: false  # No direct pushes allowed
```

#### Develop Branch Protection
```yaml
branch_protection_rules:
  develop:
    required_status_checks:
      strict: true
      contexts:
        - "ci/build"
        - "ci/test"
        - "ci/integration-test"
    required_pull_request_reviews:
      required_approving_review_count: 1
      dismiss_stale_reviews: true
    allow_force_pushes: false
```

## Endpoint-Specific Development Strategy

### 6. API Endpoint Development Process

#### Planning Phase
1. **Endpoint Specification** - Define API contract in OpenAPI format
2. **Branch Creation** - Create feature branch for specific endpoint
3. **Postman Setup** - Create endpoint-specific Postman collection
4. **Test Planning** - Define unit, integration, and API tests

#### Implementation Phase
1. **Controller Implementation** - REST endpoint with validation
2. **Service Layer** - Business logic and data processing
3. **Repository Layer** - Data access and persistence
4. **DTO Creation** - Request/response data transfer objects
5. **Validation** - Input validation with Arabic language support

#### Testing Phase
1. **Unit Tests** - Service and controller layer testing
2. **Integration Tests** - Database and external service integration
3. **API Tests** - Postman collection execution
4. **Security Tests** - Authentication and authorization validation
5. **Performance Tests** - Load testing and optimization

#### Documentation Phase
1. **API Documentation** - Update OpenAPI specifications
2. **Postman Documentation** - Request/response examples
3. **Code Comments** - Inline documentation with Arabic context
4. **Memory System Update** - Update knowledge base and patterns

### 7. Example: Authentication Endpoint Development

#### Feature Branch: `feature/auth-register`
