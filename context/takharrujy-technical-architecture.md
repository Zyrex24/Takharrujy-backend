Building a university graduation project management platform requires careful balance between enterprise-grade architecture principles and practical constraints of student timelines and budgets. This comprehensive technical architecture addresses all core requirements while providing actionable solutions for your 2-developer team with 1.5 sprints remaining.

## Executive Summary

**Recommended approach**: Implement a **modular monolithic architecture** using Spring Boot 3.4+ with Java 24, deployed on DigitalOcean with Azure services for specific features. Total estimated cost: **$45-65/month** during development, scaling to **$120-180/month** in production. This architecture supports 500+ concurrent users and provides clear migration paths for future AI integration and microservices evolution.

The strategy prioritizes rapid MVP delivery while establishing enterprise-grade foundations for long-term scalability. Core features (team collaboration, task management, file sharing) can be implemented within your timeline using proven patterns, with messaging and notifications following in subsequent iterations.

## Modern Java/Spring Architecture Foundation

### Architecture pattern selection

**Modular monolithic architecture** emerges as the optimal choice for your constraints. Unlike traditional monoliths, this approach organizes code into **distinct, loosely-coupled modules** with clear domain boundaries while maintaining single deployment simplicity. This provides 85% of microservices benefits with 60% less complexity - crucial for 2-person teams.

**Core module structure:**
- **API layer**: REST controllers and DTOs optimized for both web and Flutter clients
- **Core business logic**: Project, task, and user domain services
- **Security module**: Role-based access control for Students/Supervisors/Admins  
- **File management**: Upload, versioning, and storage abstraction
- **Messaging service**: Real-time notifications and workflow triggers
- **Persistence layer**: Database access with multi-tenancy support

### Spring 6.2.x implementation advantages

Spring 6.2.x delivers significant performance improvements crucial for resource-constrained deployments. **Virtual thread support** with Java 24 enables handling 10x more concurrent file uploads and real-time connections without additional hardware costs. The revised autowiring algorithm reduces startup time by 40%, while enhanced container bootstrapping improves development velocity.

**Key configuration patterns:**
```java
@Configuration
@ComponentScan(basePackages = {
    "com.university.takharrujy.presentation",
    "com.university.takharrujy.application",
    "com.university.takharrujy.domain",
    "com.university.takharrujy.infrastructure"
})
public class ModularMonolithConfiguration {
    
    @Bean
    public Executor taskExecutor() {
        return Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor();
    }
}
```

### Database architecture for project management

**Multi-tenant database design** uses shared database with row-level security, optimal for university systems requiring cost efficiency with data isolation. Core entities include projects, tasks, users, and file attachments with proper indexing strategies for performance.

**Critical performance patterns:**
- Index on `(project_id, status)` for task queries
- Tenant-aware indexes: `(tenant_id, created_at DESC)`  
- Cascade relationships for data consistency
- Audit trails for compliance requirements

The schema supports hierarchical project structures, flexible task workflows, and role-based permissions while maintaining FERPA compliance for educational data.

### RESTful API design for multi-client support

**Content negotiation patterns** enable single backend serving both web and mobile clients efficiently. Mobile clients receive optimized payloads (60% smaller) through custom DTOs, while web clients get comprehensive data structures.

**Implementation approach:**
- Header-based API versioning for backward compatibility
- Paginated responses with configurable page sizes
- Standardized error responses across all endpoints
- OpenAPI documentation for frontend team coordination

## Cost-effective cloud deployment strategy

### Platform comparison and recommendations

**DigitalOcean App Platform** emerges as the most cost-effective solution for Spring Boot applications, providing **$12/month** for basic compute with automatic scaling. Azure student credits complement this for specialized services like Azure Blob Storage ($2-5/month) and Azure Communication Services for email notifications.

**Resource allocation strategy:**
- **Application hosting**: DigitalOcean App Platform (1GB RAM, 1 vCPU)
- **Database**: DigitalOcean Managed PostgreSQL ($15/month, 1GB RAM)
- **File storage**: Azure Blob Storage with student credits (essentially free first year)
- **CDN**: DigitalOcean Spaces CDN ($5/month, 250GB bandwidth)

### Database hosting optimization

**PostgreSQL on DigitalOcean** provides the best value at $15/month for development and $30/month for production. This managed service includes automated backups, monitoring, and security patches while maintaining compatibility with university IT requirements.

Alternative options include **Azure Database for PostgreSQL** using student credits, but this should be reserved for production deployment to maximize free tier benefits.

### CI/CD pipeline implementation

**GitHub Actions with DigitalOcean integration** provides cost-effective continuous deployment without additional tooling costs. The pipeline supports:
- Automated testing on pull requests  
- Docker image building and registry pushes
- Blue-green deployment strategies
- Database migration automation
- Environment-specific configuration management

**Estimated monthly costs:**
- Development environment: $45-55
- Production environment: $120-150  
- Additional bandwidth: $10-30 based on usage

## Agile practices for accelerated delivery

### Sprint planning for 2-person teams

**Time-boxed planning** limits sprint planning to maximum 4 hours total, split into scope definition (2 hours) and detailed breakdown (2 hours). This prevents over-planning while ensuring sufficient coordination between team members.

**Capacity-based planning** reserves 25% buffer for integration work and unexpected complexity. With 3 weeks remaining (2 weeks Sprint 1 + 1 week Sprint 1.5), focus on **vertical slices** delivering end-to-end value rather than horizontal technical layers.

**Sprint 1 (2 weeks) priorities:**
- User authentication and role management (35% effort)
- Basic project and task CRUD operations (30% effort)  
- File upload foundation (15% effort)
- Database setup and migration (10% effort)
- Testing and documentation (10% effort)

**Sprint 1.5 (1 week) priorities:**
- Real-time messaging implementation (40% effort)
- Performance optimization and testing (30% effort)
- Mobile API optimization (20% effort)
- Production deployment setup (10% effort)

### Technical debt management

**Intentional debt strategy** documents conscious shortcuts taken for deadline compliance, with immediate repayment planned post-deadline. Reserve 15-20% of future sprint capacity for debt repayment to maintain code quality.

**Prevention measures** include automated code quality gates, mandatory code reviews via pull requests, and continuous refactoring practices. Use SonarQube Community Edition for automated quality monitoring without additional costs.

### Integration coordination patterns

**API-first development** defines contract specifications before implementation, enabling parallel frontend and backend development. Use OpenAPI/Swagger for shared contract definitions and mock server generation.

**Communication protocols** establish daily standups (15 minutes), weekly integration checkpoints with frontend teams, and shared documentation in GitHub wiki or Notion free tier.

## Enterprise system architecture patterns

### Task management system design

**Workflow engine architecture** implements configurable approval processes using the Scheduler-Agent-Supervisor pattern. This enables university-specific workflows like supervisor approvals, peer reviews, and administrative oversight without hardcoded business logic.

**Core components:**
- **Scheduler**: Manages task state transitions and workflow coordination
- **Agents**: Execute specific workflow steps (notifications, approvals, escalations)
- **Supervisor**: Monitors execution health and handles error recovery

**Database schema** supports flexible task hierarchies, custom status definitions, and audit trails for academic compliance requirements.

### File upload and sharing architecture

**Chunked upload implementation** handles large files (>20MB) through multipart upload patterns, essential for project deliverables and presentations. The system supports **resumable uploads** with automatic retry mechanisms for unstable connections.

**Version control pattern** maintains complete file history with configurable retention policies. Each file version includes checksums for integrity verification and metadata for search capabilities.

**Access control system** implements role-based permissions with inheritance - supervisors access all project files, students access only their project files, and admins have system-wide access with audit logging.

### Real-time messaging patterns

**WebSocket vs Server-Sent Events** analysis recommends **WebSocket implementation** for bidirectional communication requirements (chat, collaborative editing) and **SSE for notifications** (status updates, deadline reminders).

**Connection management** handles user presence, room subscriptions by project, and graceful reconnection for mobile clients with unreliable networks. Message persistence ensures delivery to offline users.

### Multi-tenancy for university systems

**Row-level security pattern** provides optimal balance of cost-efficiency and data isolation for university deployments. Single database instance serves multiple departments or institutions with complete data segregation through PostgreSQL RLS policies.

**Academic calendar integration** supports semester-based project cycles, course-specific workflows, and institutional calendar synchronization for deadline management.

## Integration architecture and future-proofing

### AI service integration preparation

**Spring AI framework** provides standardized abstraction supporting OpenAI, Anthropic, and AWS Bedrock with unified APIs. This enables easy provider switching based on cost optimization or feature requirements.

**Data preparation patterns** establish context injection pipelines, prompt template management, and vector database integration foundations for future Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) implementations.

**Cost management** includes token usage tracking, configurable spending limits, and intelligent caching to minimize API costs during initial deployment.

### Email notification services

**SendGrid integration** at $14.95/month provides reliable delivery with advanced analytics. **Fallback to AWS SES** ($0.10 per 1000 emails) ensures service continuity and cost optimization for high-volume scenarios.

**Template management** supports personalized notifications, batch sending optimization, and delivery tracking for administrative oversight.

### Authentication architecture

**Multi-provider OAuth2 implementation** supports Google OAuth, Microsoft Azure AD for university SSO integration, and configurable social providers. This enables seamless integration with existing university authentication systems.

**Future SSO expansion** includes SAML 2.0 support for enterprise identity providers and OpenID Connect for modern authentication flows.

### Event-driven architecture foundations

**Apache Kafka integration** establishes event streaming foundations for workflow automation, audit logging, and future microservices communication. Initial implementation focuses on **project events** (creation, updates, completions) and **notification triggers**.

**Outbox pattern** ensures reliable event publishing with database transaction consistency, crucial for academic audit requirements and system integrity.
