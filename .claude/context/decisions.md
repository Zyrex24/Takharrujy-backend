- **Status:** ✅ Approved
- **Impact:** High
- **Category:** Architecture

**Context:**
Multiple package naming conventions were found across documentation, causing confusion and potential compilation issues.

**Decision:**
Standardize all Java packages to use `com.university.takharrujy.*` structure with layered architecture:
- `com.university.takharrujy.presentation` - Controllers, DTOs, validation
- `com.university.takharrujy.application` - Services, use cases, orchestration
